# Module_Distribution_Form_System
An "Access" based Learning Module Distribution System to monitor the student's module if distributed properly

This will allow schools to monitor their learning modules distribution so they'll know if a student has recived all of their modules, or if they still have missing modules on their set.

It's released under GPL 3.0 so every school (Public or Private) can use this Database Sample and they could manipulate this Database to their liking.
